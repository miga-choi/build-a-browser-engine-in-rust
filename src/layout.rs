/**

 *  because it's where the box's content is drawn. The content may be text, image, video,
 *  or other boxes.
 *
 *  a box may also have padding, borders, and margins surrounding its content area. The CSS
 *  spec has a [diagram](https://www.w3.org/tr/css2/box.html#box-dimensions) showing how
 *  all these layers fit together.
 *
 *  the engine stores a box's content area and surrounding areas in the following structure.
 *
 *  rust note: `f32` is a 32-bit floating point type.

/*
    block and inline layout

    the css display property determines which type of box an element generates. CSS
    defines several box types, each with its own layout rules. Here only going to talk
    about two of them: "block" and "inline".

    I'll use this bit of pseudo-HTML to illustrate the difference:
        <container>
            <a></a>
            <b></b>
            <c></c>
            <d></d>
        </container>
 */


/*
    A box can be a block node, an inline node, or an anonymous block box. (This will
    need to change when I implement text layout, because line wrapping can cause a
    single inline node to split into multiple boxes. But it will do for now.)
 */
enum BoxType<'a> {
    BlockNode(&'a style::StyledNode<'a>),
    InlineNode(&'a style::StyledNode<'a>),
    AnonymousBlock,
}


/// A node in the layout tree.
/*
    The Layout Tree

    The layout tree is a collection of boxes. A box has dimensions, and it may contain
    child boxes.
 */

    pub dimensions: Dimensions,
    pub box_type: BoxType<'a>,
    pub children: Vec<LayoutBox<'a>>,
}


/**

 *  no specified value it returns the initial value, "inline".
